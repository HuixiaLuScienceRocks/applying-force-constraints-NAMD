### Fine tune protein structures---newly established method

### Credit attributed to Dr. Huixia Lu, 4 June 2025

## Results:
**beginning.png** shows the meaningful atomic distance before fine tunning (unstable packing between monomers of protein molecule), and **fine-tunning-16mer.png** shows the corresponding distances after fine-tunning (anti-beta paralelling between monomers has been established).
