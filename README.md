## Results:
The image **beginning.png** displays the initial atomic distances prior to fine-tuning, showing *unstable packing between protein monomers*.

In contrast, **fine-tuning-16mer.png** shows the refined distances after fine-tuning, where a*nti-beta parallel alignment between monomers has been established*.
